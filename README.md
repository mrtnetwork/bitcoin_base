### Transaction Types

ss
This comprehensive package provides robust support for a wide array of Bitcoin transaction types, encompassing the full spectrum of Bitcoin transaction capabilities. Whether you need to execute standard payments, facilitate complex multi-signature wallets, leverage Segregated Witness (SegWit) transactions for lower fees and enhanced scalability, or embrace the privacy and flexibility of Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) transactions, this package has you covered. Additionally, it empowers users to engage in legacy transactions, create time-locked transactions, and harness the security of multisignature (multisig) transactions. With this package, you can seamlessly navigate the diverse landscape of Bitcoin transactions, ensuring your interactions with the Bitcoin network are secure, efficient, and tailored to your specific needs.

- P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash): The most common transaction type, it sends funds to a recipient's public key hash. Provides security and anonymity.

- P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash): Allows more complex scripts to be used, enhancing Bitcoin's capabilities by enabling features like multisignature wallets.

- P2WPKH (Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash): A Segregated Witness (SegWit) transaction type, it offers reduced fees and improved scalability while maintaining compatibility.

- P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash): Another SegWit transaction, it extends the benefits of SegWit to more complex script scenarios, reducing transaction size and fees.

- P2TR (Pay-to-Taproot): An upgrade aiming to improve privacy and flexibility, allowing users to choose between various scripts and enhance transaction efficiency.

- Legacy Transactions: Refers to older transaction types used before SegWit, with higher fees and less scalability.

- Multisignature (Multisig) Transactions: Involves multiple signatures to authorize a Bitcoin transaction, commonly used for security purposes in shared wallets.

- SegWit Transactions: A collective term for P2WPKH and P2WSH transactions, leveraging segregated witness data to reduce transaction size and fees.

- Time-Locked Transactions: These transactions have a predetermined time or block height before they can be spent, adding security and functionality to Bitcoin smart contracts.

- Coinbase Transactions: The first transaction in each block, generating new Bitcoins as a block reward for miners. It includes the miner's payout address.

### Tokens on Bitcoin Cash

CashTokens are digital assets that can be created and used on the global, decentralized Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network. These tokens can be issued by any person, organization, or decentralized application.

- Fungible tokens: Create, sign, spend, and burn.

- Non-fungible tokens: Create, sign, mint, send, and burn with multiple capabilities (none, mutable, minting).

- BCMR: Metadata Registries CHIP

### Create Transaction

Using this package, you can create a Bitcoin transaction in two ways: either through the `BtcTransaction` or the `BitcoinTransactionBuilder` class

- BtcTransaction: To use the `BtcTransaction` class, you should have a general understanding of how Bitcoin transactions work, including knowledge of UTXOs, scripts, various types of scripts, Bitcoin addresses, signatures, and more. We created examples and tests to enhance your understanding. An example of this transaction type is explained below, and you can also find numerous examples in the [`test`](https://github.com/mrtnetwork/bitcoin_base/tree/main/test) folder.

- BitcoinTransactionBuilder: Even with limited prior knowledge, you can utilize this class to send various types of transactions. Below, I've provided an example in which a transaction features 8 distinct input addresses with different types and private keys, as well as 10 different output addresses. Furthermore, additional examples have been prepared, which you can find in the [`example`](https://github.com/mrtnetwork/bitcoin_base/tree/main/example) folder.

### PSBT
  Find example implementations [here](https://github.com/mrtnetwork/bitcoin_base/tree/main/example/lib/psbt)

- BIP-0174: Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction Format
- BIP-0370: PSBT Version 2
- BIP-0371: Taproot Fields for PSBT
- BIP-0373: MuSig2 PSBT Fields

### MuSig2 (BIP-327):
  Find example implementations [here](https://github.com/mrtnetwork/bitcoin_base/tree/main/example/lib/musig)

 - Sign/Verify: Supports signing and verifying multisignature transactions using MuSig2
 - NonceAgg: Aggregates nonces from multiple participants for secure signature generation.
 - KeyAgg: Combines multiple public keys into a single aggregated public key for efficient multisignature verification



### Addresses

- P2PKH A P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash) address in Bitcoin represents ownership of a cryptocurrency wallet by encoding a hashed public key
  
- P2WPKH: A P2WPKH (Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash) address in Bitcoin is a Segregated Witness (SegWit) address that enables more efficient and secure transactions by segregating witness data, enhancing network scalability and security.
  
- P2WSH: A P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash) address in Bitcoin is a Segregated Witness (SegWit) address that allows users to spend bitcoins based on the conditions specified in a witness script, offering improved security and flexibility for complex transaction types.
  
- P2TR: A P2TR (Pay-to-Taproot) address in Bitcoin is a type of address that allows users to send and receive bitcoins using the Taproot smart contract, offering enhanced privacy and scalability features.
  
- P2SH: A P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash) address in Bitcoin is an address type that enables the use of more complex scripting, often associated with multi-signature transactions or other advanced smart contract functionality, enhancing flexibility and security.
  
- P2SH(SEGWIT): A P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash) Segregated Witness (SegWit) address in Bitcoin combines the benefits of P2SH and SegWit technologies, allowing for enhanced transaction security, reduced fees, and improved scalability.

### Addresses specific to Bitcoin Cash

- P2SH32: Pay to Script Hash 32

- P2SH32WT: Pay to Script Hash 32 With Token

- P2PKHWT: Pay to Public Key Hash With Token

### Sign

- Sign message: ECDSA Signature Algorithm
  
- Sign Segwit(v0) and legacy transaction: ECDSA Signature Algorithm
  
- Sign Taproot transaction
  
  - Script Path and TapTweak: Taproot allows for multiple script paths (smart contract conditions) to be included in a single transaction. The "taptweak" ensures that the correct
    script path is used when spending. This enhances privacy by making it difficult to determine the spending conditions from the transaction.

  - Schnorr Signatures: While ECDSA is still used for Taproot, it also provides support for Schnorr signatures. Schnorr signatures offer benefits such as smaller signature sizes and
    signature aggregation, contributing to improved scalability and privacy.

  - Schnorr-Musig: Taproot can leverage Schnorr-Musig, a technique for securely aggregating multiple signatures into a single signature. This feature enables collaborative spending and
    enhances privacy.

### Node Provider

We have integrated three APIs—Mempool, BlockCypher, and Electrum—into the plugin to facilitate network access. These APIs enable seamless retrieval of information such as unspent transactions (UTXO), network fees, sending transactions, receiving transaction details, and fetching account transactions.

## EXAMPLES

### Key and addresses

- Private key

    ```dart
    // Create an EC private key instance from a WIF (Wallet Import Format) encoded string.
    final privateKey =
      ECPrivate.fromWif("cT33CWKwcV8afBs5NYzeSzeSoGETtAB8izjDjMEuGqyqPoF7fbQR", netVersion: BitcoinNetwork.mainnet.wifNetVer);

    // Retrieve the corresponding public key from the private key.
    final publicKey = privateKey.getPublic();

    // Sign an input using the private key.
    final signSegwitV0OrLagacy = privateKey.signECDSA();

    // Sign a Taproot transaction using the private key.
    final signSegwitV1TapprotTransaction = privateKey.signBip340();

    // Convert the private key to a WIF (Wallet Import Format) encoded string.
    // The boolean argument specifies whether to use the compressed format.
    final toWif = privateKey.toWif();

    // Convert the private key to its hexadecimal representation.
    final toHex = privateKey.toHex();

  final compressedBytes = publicKey.toCompressedBytes();

  // Get the uncompressed bytes representation of the public key.
  final unCompressedBytes = publicKey.toBytes();

  // Extract and return the x-coordinate (first 32 bytes) of the ECPublic key as a hexadecimal string.
  final onlyX = publicKey.toXOnlyHex();

  // Compute and return the Taproot commitment point's x-coordinate
  // derived from the ECPublic key and an optional script, represented as a hexadecimal string.

- With ForkedTransactionBuilder

  ForkedTransactionBuilder supports the BitcoinCash and bitcoinSV for easy creation and signing of various address types.
  For spending network amounts, it functions similarly to TransactionBuilder. However, in this example, the focus is on spending CashToken (BCH Feature). For minting, burning, and creating FTs (Fungible Tokens) and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), you can refer to the [example folders](https://github.com/mrtnetwork/bitcoin_base/tree/main/example/lib/bitcoin_cash)

- With BtcTransaction
  - Spend P2TR UTXO

    // Parameters
    //  amount: This is the quantity of Bitcoin being sent to the recipient's address.
    //  It represents the value of the transaction output in Bitcoin.

    //  scriptPubKey: This is a script that specifies the conditions that must be met in order to spend the output.
    //  It includes the recipient's Bitcoin address (encoded in a specific way)
    //  and can also include additional conditions or requirements based on the type of script used.

### Node provider

I haven't implemented any specific HTTP service or socket service within this plugin. The reason is that different applications may use various plugins or methods to interact with network protocols. However, I have included numerous examples to demonstrate how Electrum and HTTP services can be utilized. You can leverage these examples as a reference to easily create services tailored to your application's specific needs. [examples](https://github.com/mrtnetwork/bitcoin_base/tree/main/example/lib/services_examples)

- Electrum API (Websocket, TCP, SSL)

```dart
  const network = BitcoinNetwork.mainnet;

  /// connect to electrum service with websocket
  /// please see `services_examples` folder for how to create electrum websocket service
  final service =
      await ElectrumSSLService.connect("testnet.aranguren.org:51002");

  /// create provider with service
  final provider = ElectrumProvider(service);

  final address = P2trAddress.fromAddress(address: ".....", network: network);

  /// Return the confirmed and unconfirmed balances of a script hash.
  final accountBalance = await provider
      .request(ElectrumGetScriptHashBalance(scriptHash: address.pubKeyHash()));

  /// Return an ordered list of UTXOs sent to a script hash.
  final accountUnspend = await provider
      .request(ElectrumRequestScriptHashListUnspent(scriptHash: address.pubKeyHash()));

  /// Return the confirmed and unconfirmed history of a script hash.
  final accountHistory = await provider
      .request(ElectrumScriptHashGetHistory(scriptHash: address.pubKeyHash()));

  /// Broadcast a transaction to the network.
  final broadcastTransaction = await provider
      .request(ElectrumRequestBroadCastTransaction(transactionRaw: "txDigest"));

  /// ....
```

- Explorer API (blockCypher, mempool)

```dart
  /// Define the blockchain network you want to work with, in this case, it's Bitcoin.
  const network = BitcoinNetwork.mainnet;

  /// see the example_service.dart for how to create a http service.
  final service = BitcoinApiService();

  /// Create an API provider instance for interacting with the BlockCypher API for the specified network.
  final api = ApiProvider.fromBlocCypher(network, service);

  /// Get the current network fee rate, which is essential for estimating transaction fees.
  final fee = await api.getNetworkFeeRate();

  /// Send a raw transaction represented by its transaction digest to the blockchain network.
  final transactionId = await api.sendRawTransaction("txDigest");

  /// Retrieve the Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) associated with a specific address.
  final utxo = await api.getAccountUtxo(address);

  /// Fetch information about a specific transaction using its transaction ID.
  /// For the Mempool API, use MempoolTransaction in the function template to receive the correct type.
  final transaction =
      await api.getTransaction<BlockCypherTransaction>(transactionId);

  /// Get a list of account transactions related to a specific address.
  /// For the Mempool API, use MempoolTransaction in the function template to receive the correct type.
  final accountTransactions =
      await api.getAccountTransactions<MempoolTransaction>('address');
```
